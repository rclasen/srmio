srmio
=====

srmio is a library to access the most important functions of a Schoberer
Radmesstechnik (SRM) PowerControl V. You can download the data, mark it
deleted, sync the time and set the recording interval. So hopefully
you'll get around booting windows after each exercise. Though it is not
intended as a replacement.

To be as compatible as possible, it's reading (SRM6/SRM7) and writing
(SRM7) files in a the format srmwin uses.

For now I consider it to be alpha quality at most, so ...


******* !!! USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK, IT MIGHT HARM YOUR SRM !!!  ****


Please take this warning serious. I've had no docs for the protocol, so I
had to figure it out myself. While I had luck with srmwin bringing
everything back to normal, you might not.

I've used the original prolific-based USB 2 Serial download cable on linux
2.6.27.

If you just want to use it, please check
 man srmcmd

Please reade the comments in the source (start with srmio.h) if you want
to use the lib.

Of course I'm open to all suggestions, comments and patches.
